Code can be concise and beautiful.  Code can be clean and
self-explanatory.  Code can be performant and economical.  Code can be
thoroughly tested and refactored and reviewed.  Code can even be
golfed down to be unrecognisable.

*This code is none of that.*

This code is quick, as in "quickly spat out".

Do not use it as an example for good code.

I believe it can still be helpful to find ways to look at a problem
that you have missed, or find a feature of the language that you
didn't know existed.

Have fun and tell me what you think if you want :-)
